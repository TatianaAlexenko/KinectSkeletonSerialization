KinectSkeletonSerialization
===========================

Serialize and Deserialize a Microsoft Kinect Skeleton to JSON string and back. 
Code is in C# and meant to be used with Microsoft Kinect SDK. 

I needed to serialize AND deserealize Kinect Skeletons to some string Format. 
I found this https://github.com/dodilp/kinectcouchbase/blob/master/Kinect.Server/SkeletonSerializer.cs, but it didn't have deseralization back to skeleton. 

Took about an hour to figure out typecasting and resolve bugs. Enjoy. 

I assume no resposibility for what happens when you use this code, blah, blah, blah.
I also don't care what you use it for.
